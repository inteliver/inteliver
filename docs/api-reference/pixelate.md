### Pixelate Operation

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Command</th>
    <th>Details</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>i_o_pixelate_{value}</td>
    <td>Pixelate the image with respect to the value. Value can be an integer between 0 and 20. The args value to this modifier will specify the intensiveness of the pixelate operation.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

???+ tip
      The default behaviour of the pixelate image effect is to apply the pixelate function on the whole image. 

???+ tip
      Setting the selection window before pixelate operation will result in pixelating only the selection window.

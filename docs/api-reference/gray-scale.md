### Grayscale Operation

    <td>i_o_gray</td>
    <td>Make the image grayscale.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


???+ tip
      The default behaviour of the grayscale image effect is to apply the grayscale function on the whole image. 


???+ tip
      Setting the selection window before grayscale operation will result in applying the grayscale effect only on the selection window.

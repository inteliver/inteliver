### Blur Operation

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Command</th>
    <th>Details</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>i_o_blur_{value}</td>
    <td>Blur the image with respect to the value. Value can be an integer between 0 and 100. The args value to this modifier will specify the intensiveness of the blur operation.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

!!! tip
      The default behaviour of the blur image effect is to apply the blur function on the whole image. 

!!! tip
      Setting the selection window before blur operation will result in bluring only the selection window.
